## v2.0.0

The tailwind-merge v2 release has been sitting here almost finished for 2 months already. But the timing was never quite right, especially thinking about the increased support needed after the release. In the meantime, the product of the company I work at [launched in public beta](https://medium.com/@risecal/meet-rise-the-calendar-that-works-for-you-were-launching-the-public-beta-today-bc07555a2191) and I married. Thank you for your patience.

This release focuses on making it easier to configure the library for new users. Check out the [migration guide](./v1-to-v2-migration.md) and if you have any questions, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/issues/new/choose).

### Breaking Changes

-   Fix `background-image` and `background-position` being merged incorrectly by [@dcastil](https://github.com/dcastil) in [#300](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/pull/300)
    -   Values for `background-position` and `background-size` can look very similar and Tailwind CSS uses the same `bg-` prefix for both groups. This results in some [limitations](../limitations.md) for tailwind-merge. If you use background position or background size with arbitrary values, please read [this section](../limitations.md#you-need-to-use-label-in-arbitrary-background-position-and-background-size-classes) about how to use them.
